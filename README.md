# Cgpa Calculator - Web
This is the source code of the CGPA Calculator project website.
www.cgpacalc.xyz

### Getting started

To setup the project files for development and contribution, please make sure you perform the following steps.

1. Create a project in Firebase console and upload the __database2013.json__ into the project. (This is to ensure that the same database exists as of the original project database for testing)
2. Goto __indexpage.js__ and update the Firebase configuration.

That's it.

### What to contribute?

As like in CGPA Calculator Android application, the website too has a dashboard. But the dashboard is still not implemented.

1. You can design a dashboard matching the site's style. (See below for where to get the resources)
2. Implement a search feature in the main page.

If you are coming up with your own ideas, you are free to implement.
